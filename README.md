## Hello, I'm Svyatoslav Sklokin!
I am currently finishing up the second year of my bachelor's degree in computer science at McGill University. 

I am open to all opportunities related to interactive media^^

This github account is mainly placeholder, as most of the projects I contribute to are scattered all over. For example,
my most recent one is an entry for the Ubisoft Game Lab 2022 competition, which can be found at Azure: https://dev.azure.com/McGill-Team-3/_git/Gameslab

The MAIS shakespearean english / modern english translator is found at https://github.com/SlavaSklokin/MAIS202ML-Shakespeare-Translator.

Smaller projects include our entry for McGameJam 2021, https://itch.io/jam/mcgame-jam-2021/rate/886354, and McHacks 8 https://devpost.com/software/mishookoo-deskcat.
